# Semantic comparison

<p> In this task we will work with overriding magic methods.</p>

<p> To solve this task we need:
1. Override magic comparison methods __lt__ and __ne__.
2. Import functools module, which implement other comparison methods.
3. Convert string representation of the version to list.</p>


# Q & A

*<p> Why we use loguru instead of
the built-in logging module? </p>*

- No Handler, no Formatter, no Filter:
  one function to rule them all
- Easier file logging with rotation / retention / compression
- Modern string formatting using braces style
- Exceptions catching within threads or main
- Pretty logging with colors
- Fully descriptive exceptions
- Better datetime handling
- Entirely compatible with standard logging
- 10x faster than built-in logging

# Functional requirements

- All the versions successfully complete comparisons.

# How to run a script

- Install python3, if missing
  https://www.python.org/downloads/.
  
- To run the script
  you need to copy the path to the .py file,
  and write the following 
  construction: "python3 path-to-file"
  into terminal/command line.
